# SHFT
Hey,
Before I begin, I must provide the necessary information.
Notifications aren't tested and probably won't work on Foreground/Background. I thought notifee can make scheduled/trigger events on different states but it cant, or i misunderstood.
and finally, i haven't tested the app on a real device because i don't have any android device, and a macbook. So if you see a bug i'm sorry about that..


You can clone the repo with: git clone https://github.com/tunabsdrmz/SHFT.git 
and 'npm i' for downloading packages.
and run 'npm run android'.
There is a bell on the top right corner of the home screen. Normally if it is on you should get a notification every 15 minutes, but as I said I don't think it works.

You know the 'daily weekly monthly' buttons.

The cards are a little different from your design, you can swipe it left and right.

Share button on Goal screen allows you to send me a link but i didn't test it feel free to test it for me.

Recommend text is changing depends on your progress.

Thank you.
